# Pico SD Card Bootloader

A bootloader for the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) that allows updating firmware from a SD card.

## Overview

This bootloader enables RP2040 firmware updates using a SD card instead of USB.
Useful for designs where the USB port is inaccessible, otherwise occupied, or it is inconvenient to use a laptop to update firmware.

### Key Features

- Uses standard .uf2 files for firmware updates
- No custom linker script required
- Validates firmware integrity before flashing

## Quick Start

Note: the prebuilt binaries only work with the original Raspberry Pi Pico board.  If using a different board,
you will need to modify [config.cmake](config.cmake) and build bootloader.uf2 locally.

### 1. Connect a SD adapter

Connect a 3.3V-compatible SD adapter to your Raspberry Pi Pico:

| Pico Pin | GPIO      | Adapter Pin | Description             |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 21       | 16 (RX)   | DO          | Data out (from card)    |
| 22       | 17        | CS/SS       | Chip select             |
| 24       | 18 (SCK)  | SCK         | Serial clock            |
| 25       | 19 (TX)   | DI          | Data in (to card)       |
| 23       | GND       | GND/VSS     | Ground                  |
| 36       | 3V3 (Out) | 3V3/VCC     | Power                   |
| 29       | 22 (In)   | CD/DAT3     | Card detect (optional)  |

### 2. Install Bootloader (One-Time Setup)

1. Connect the Pico via USB while holding the BOOTSEL button
2. Copy [bootloader.uf2](dist/bootloader.uf2) to the mounted USB drive
3. The Pico will restart and flash "N" in Morse code (long-short pattern) indicating no firmware

### 3. Update firmware via SD card

1. Copy the example [firmware.uf2](dist/firmware.uf2) to a FAT32-formatted SD card
2. Insert the card into the adapter connected to your Pico
3. The LED will blink rapidly during flashing, then the device will restart
4. When successful, the LED will "breathe" as it fades in and out

## How It Works

The normal [RP2040 boot process](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Bootloader/Boot_sequence.html) is as follows:

1. The ROM bootloader runs loads the stage 2 bootloader from the first block of flash.
2. The stage 2 bootloader configures the flash for XIP (execute in place) and jumps to the main program.

This project modifies this process by:

1. The ROM bootloader runs the stage 2 bootloader as normal
2. A modified stage 2 bootloader jumps to a new stage 3 bootloader that resides in the last 64kB of flash
3. The stage 3 bootloader checks for an inserted SD card with a 'firmware.uf2' file
4. If found, it validates the UF2 file and writes it to flash.
5. The stage 3 bootloader jumps to the normal program area.

The bootloader preserves itself during firmware updates by skipping the normal stage 2 bootloader included in the .uf2 file.  It also checks that the new firmware does not overwrite the last 64kB where the stage 3 bootloader resides.

## Tips and Caveats

When working with this bootloader, keep these important points in mind:

* **Preserving the bootloader**: If you flash the Pico using USB or an SWD debugger (like Picoprobe or Debug Probe), it will overwrite the custom stage 2 bootloader. To restore SD card update functionality, you will need to reinstall [bootloader.uf2](dist/bootloader.uf2).

* **Write-protected UF2 files**: If the 'firmware.uf2' file on your SD card is write-protected, the bootloader will not be able to delete it after flashing. This can be useful when updating multiple devices with the same card, but may cause slower startup times if you leave the SD card inserted. This happens because the bootloader will repeatedly check if the UF2 file differs from the installed firmware.

## Customizing

Modify [config.cmake](config.cmake) to configure the following:

* Board (defaults to 'pico')
* Firmware filename (defaults to 'firmware.uf2')
* SD card SPI instance, pins, and optional card detection
* Diagnostics options:
  * Enable/disable LED diagnostic codes and select LED pin
  * Enable/disable serial UART diagnostics and select TX/RX pins and baud rate
